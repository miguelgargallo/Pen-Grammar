#1 grammar - .mdp Grammar for TextMate

#2 Introduction

The .mdp grammar is a set of rules for defining the syntax and formatting of .mdp files in TextMate. The grammar includes rules for highlighting keywords, functions, and other elements of the .mdp syntax.

#2 Syntax

The .mdp grammar includes syntax for the following elements:

- Headings: Headings are defined using the "#" symbol, followed by a number and the heading text. For example, "#1 Heading" or "#2 Subheading".
- Paragraphs: Paragraphs are defined by a blank line preceding the paragraph text.
- Lists: Lists can be either bulleted or numbered, and are defined using the "bullet" or "number" keywords, followed by the list items. For example, "bullet List item 1" or "number 1. List item 1".
- Code blocks: Code blocks are defined using three backticks (```) preceding and following the code block.
- Tables: Tables are defined using the "|" symbol to separate columns and the "-" symbol to define the header row. For example:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Row 1    | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Row 2    | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |

#2 Formatting

The .mdp grammar also includes rules for formatting elements such as bold, italic, and strikethrough text. These are defined using the following symbols:

- Bold: **bold text**
- Italic: _italic text_
- Strikethrough: ~~strikethrough text~~
